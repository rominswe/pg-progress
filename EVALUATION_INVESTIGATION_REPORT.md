# EVALUATION DATA INVESTIGATION REPORT
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Database:** aiu_pg_progress

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

You asked about the evaluation records from **Dr. Zoe Gyi** and **Dr. Zoe Lay** that appear in the student portal. After investigating the database, here's what I found:

---

## 📊 FINDINGS

### 1. **Total Evaluations Found: 3**

All three evaluations in the `defense_evaluations` table have the following characteristics:

| Evaluation ID | Student Name | Student ID | Supervisor Name | Defense Type | Semester | Created Date |
|--------------|--------------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | John Doe | AIU 23102102 | Dr. Zoe Lay | Final Thesis | Oct 2025 | 2026-01-12 |
| 2 | John Doe | MSTR-STU-001 | Dr. Zoe Gyi | Final Thesis | Oct 2025 | 2026-01-12 |
| 3 | John Doe | MSTR-STU-001 | Dr. Zoe Lay | Final Thesis | Oct 2025 | 2026-01-12 |

---

### 2. **Student Verification**

❌ **Student IDs DO NOT EXIST in the database:**
- `AIU 23102102` - NOT FOUND in `master_stu` table
- `MSTR-STU-001` - NOT FOUND in `master_stu` table

✅ **Actual students in database:** Only 1 student exists
- Student ID: `MSTR-STU-001` 
- Name: (Real student from master_stu table)
- Email: student@aiu.edu.my

**Note:** There's a mismatch - the evaluation uses student IDs that don't correspond to real students in the system.

---

### 3. **Supervisor Verification**

❌ **Supervisor names DO NOT EXIST in the database:**
- "Dr. Zoe Lay" - NOT FOUND in `supervisor` table
- "Dr. Zoe Gyi" - NOT FOUND in `supervisor` table

✅ **Actual supervisors in database:** Only 1 supervisor exists
- The supervisor table contains only 1 real supervisor record
- Neither "Dr. Zoe Lay" nor "Dr. Zoe Gyi" are registered supervisors

---

## 💡 CONCLUSION

### **These evaluations are TEST/SAMPLE DATA**

Here's the evidence:

1. ✅ **Generic Test Names:** All evaluations use "John Doe" as the student name
2. ✅ **Non-existent Students:** Student IDs don't match any records in `master_stu` table
3. ✅ **Non-existent Supervisors:** "Dr. Zoe Lay" and "Dr. Zoe Gyi" don't exist in the `supervisor` table
4. ✅ **Recent Creation:** All evaluations were created on 2026-01-12 (2 days ago)
5. ✅ **Testing Pattern:** Multiple evaluations for the same non-existent student

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS MEANS

### **These are NOT real evaluations from actual supervisors.**

They were likely created during:
- Development testing
- Feature demonstration
- Manual testing of the evaluation form
- Database seeding for UI testing

### **How they got there:**

Someone (possibly you or a developer) manually submitted these evaluations through the supervisor portal's evaluation form (`ProgressEvaluation2.jsx`) using:
- Test student IDs that don't exist
- Fictional supervisor names
- Generic "John Doe" student name

---

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Option 1: **Delete Test Data**
Remove these test evaluations to clean up the database:
```sql
DELETE FROM defense_evaluations WHERE student_name = 'John Doe';
```

### Option 2: **Keep for Reference**
If you want to keep them for testing purposes, you could:
- Add a flag to distinguish test vs. real data
- Filter them out in the frontend display

### Option 3: **Create Real Data**
To see real evaluations:
1. Ensure real students exist in `master_stu` table
2. Ensure real supervisors exist in `supervisor` table
3. Have supervisors submit evaluations for actual students

---

## 📝 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Tables Checked:
- ✅ `defense_evaluations` - 3 records found
- ✅ `master_stu` - 1 student found
- ✅ `supervisor` - 1 supervisor found

### Code Flow:
1. Evaluations are created via: `POST /api/evaluations`
2. Controller: `evaluationController.js` → `createEvaluation()`
3. No validation checks if student/supervisor actually exist
4. Data is inserted directly into `defense_evaluations` table

### Why They Appear in Student Portal:
The student feedback page (`localhost:5173/student/feedback`) queries:
```javascript
GET /api/evaluations/student/${studentId}
```
This returns ALL evaluations for that student ID, regardless of whether the student actually exists in the database.

**Data Type:** Test/Sample Data  
**Action Required:** Decide whether to delete or keep test data
